# Slack AskBot
A bot to perform small questionnaires in Slack

This is still a very much a work in progress so this shouldn't probably be used by anyone.

## Roadmap
 1. Loading questionnaire from file / console / etc
 1. Deployment from CI
 1. Answer reporting to proper place
 1. Table storage cleanup

## Setup steps

### Creating application
1. Create the environment. For example:

```bash
pwsh Deployment/Prepare-Environment.ps1
```
Or the individual steps
  - ```
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
    -Name "my-deploy-name" `
    -TemplateFile Deployment/azuredeploy.json `
    -ResourceGroupName "my-resource-group" `
    -appName "my-function-app-name" `
    -environment Development `
    -slackBearerToken (ConvertTo-SecureString -String "your token here" -AsPlainText -Force)
   ```

   Save tableStorageConnection that is generated by the deployment. This can be later fetched from
   table storage settings. This is used by ConsoleTester to manage questionnaires.
  - Publish application
    The following will build and publish this application
    ```
    .\Deployment\Publish.ps1 -ResourceGroup "my-resource-group" -WebAppName "my-function-app-name"
    ```
1. Retrieve function url
    Azure Functions Webhook URL can only be retrieved after the application is deployed.
   ```
   .\Deployment\GetFunctionUri.ps1 -ResourceGroup "my-resource-group" -WebAppName "my-function-app-name"
   ```

   Note: This script may throw `The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a send.`
   or similar error if wrong SecurityProtocol is used. This requires TLS 1.2.

   Following will fix the issue for PowerShell session
   ```
   [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12;
   ```
1. Change logic apps web hook uri at https://api.slack.com/apps "Interactive Components"

## Usage
Console interface of this software uses [CommandLineParser](https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline).

Using command line parameters differs a little bit depending on where you run this software.

Examples in this section assume that commands are run from `ConsoleTester`-folder.

For up to date help

```
dotnet run -- help 
```

### Testing
After creating the environment, for instance by executing
```bash
pwsh Deployment/Prepare-Environment.ps1
```
you can quickly test the function is operating normally by

```bash
pwsh ./Testing/Test-Validation.ps1
```

### Configuring ConsoleTester
Configurations are read from `appsettings.json` and `appsettings.Development.json`.

For actual usage, set connection string generated in [Create Application](#create-application) as
ConnectionString under TableStorage-section in `appsettings.json`-file

For development, create `appsettings.Delopment.json` and fill your
storage connections string generated earlier there.

### Creating new questionnaires
Questionnaires are created by reading JSON file.

1. Generate questionnaire template `dotnet run -- generateTemplate -o 'example-questionnaire.json'` 
1. Change question, add/change/remove answers
1. Add questionnaire `dotnet run -- create -f 'example-questionnaire.json' -c test-channel`

Example questionnaire JSON
```
{
  "Question": "How are our code monkeys doing today?",
  "AnswerOptions": [
    "Yes",
    "Very much no.",
    ":feelsbadman:"
  ]
}
```

### Fetching answers

Fetching questionnaire ID:s
```
dotnet run -- questionnaires
```

Fetching answers for all questionnaires
```
dotnet run -- answers
```

Fetching answers for single questionnaire
```
dotnet run -- answers -q e746a0db-6984-4fc4-8d6d-b5fad5baaa90
```

Writing answers to CSV-file
```
dotnet run -- answers -q e746a0db-6984-4fc4-8d6d-b5fad5baaa90 -o test.csv
```
